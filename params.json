{"name":"NineML","tagline":"NineML neuroscience model description language.","body":"### Purpose\r\nNineML is a simulator independent language with the aim of providing an unambiguous description of neuronal network models for efficient model sharing and reusability.\r\n\r\nThis language has emerged from a joint effort of experts in the fields of computational neuroscience, simulator development and simulator-independent language initiatives ([NeuroML](http://www.neuroml.org/), [PyNN](http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/)), grouped in the [INCF Multiscale Modeling Task Force](https://www.incf.org/activities/our-programs/modeling/people).\r\nThis effort was initiated and is still supported by the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility](http://www.incf.org) (INCF), as part of the standardization effort of the [Multiscale Modeling Program](https://www.incf.org/activities/our-programs/modeling), but the project is now run as a community project, with an elected editorial board.\r\n\r\n### Specifications\r\n\r\nThe specifications are available as PDF document. (TODO: insert download link)\r\n\r\n### About\r\n\r\nTODO: include here an introduction to NineML\r\n\r\n### Software\r\n\r\n* Python ``nineml`` package: Documentation-TODO [Download](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/9ML/)\r\n* Chicken Scheme NineML Toolkit: Documentation-TODO [Download](http://software.incf.org/software/nineml/download)\r\n\r\n### Mailing lists\r\n\r\n* [NineML developers](http://lists.incf.org/mailman/listinfo/nineml-developers): planning to get involved in the further development of NineML, join this list to get in touch with the taskforce and the API developers.\r\n* [NineML users](http://lists.incf.org/mailman/listinfo/nineml-users): Want to use NineML but do not know how to do it? Need more information about the use of the APIs, have questions regarding NineML, join this list and we will give as much detail as possible to satisfy your curiosity.\r\n\r\n### Getting involved\r\n\r\nBylaws...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
